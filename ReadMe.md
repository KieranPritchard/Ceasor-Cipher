# Ceasor Cipher

## Project Description

This project is a Ceasor cipher, it encrypts messages based around a techique created by juilous ceasor used during his reign in the roman empire.

The main reason for doing this is because, I became really invested in learning different areas of cyber security. as part of this, I did some reasearch into projects I can do in python. Then I came across this video on youtube: []()

Because I already had cryptography bouncing around my head for a while before watching this, I decided this was the project i will chose from the video above. 

My main and only challenge, was figuring out what I could do differently. why I say this is because i don't do projects unless, I can change and add new features to them. The new features are inputs for messages and shifts, as well as user menus for terminal.
