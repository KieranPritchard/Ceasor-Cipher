## Project Description
### Objective
To create a cryptography based project, after inspiration from a cyber security course I did and this video on youtube: [Link to project tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDh1UT5rUsU). This project is based around an encryption method used by Julius Caesar
### Technology and Tools Used:
* **Language:** Python.
* **Framework/Library:** string and sys.
* **Tools:** VS Code.
### Challenges Faced
My main challenge was what I could do differently. This is because I don't take on projects unless I can do something different. What I did differently was put a CLI on it, Command Line Interface.
### Outcome
Successfully created a cryptography based project, after doing this I want to create another cryptography based project in the future. I also applied knowledge from the course I done
## How to Use the Project
1. **Clone The Repository:**
	* This saves the project to your local device, you can do this using git.
2. **Run The Program:**
	* Open the terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the project. 
	* After you have done this run the following command: `python Ceasor_Cipher.py`.
3. **Choose An Operation:**
	* When you start the program, you'll see a menu with three options:
		* **(1) Encryption:** This encrypts a message.
		* **(2) Decryption:** This Decrypts a message.
		* **(3) Exit:** This exits the program.
4. **Input Your Choice:**
	* When prompted type `1`, `2`, or `3` and then press enter to choose the desired operation.
5. **For Encryption:**
	* If you chose option 1:
		* Input a **shift value** (an integer) when prompted, this will determine how many letters to shift across.
		* Then enter the message you want to encrypt, the program will then encrypt and display the encrypted message.
6. **For Decryption:**
	 * If you chose option 2:
		* Input the same **shift value** you used for encryption.
		* Input the encrypted message, then the program will decrypt and display the orignal message.
7. **Exit The Program:**
	* To exit the program, select option 3 to-do so.
