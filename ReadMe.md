## Project Description

This project is a Ceasor cipher, it encrypts messages based around a techique created by juilous ceasor used during his reign in the roman empire.

The main reason for doing this is because, I became really invested in learning different areas of cyber security. as part of this, I did some reasearch into projects I can do in python. Then I came across this video on youtube: [Link to project tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDh1UT5rUsU)

Because I already had cryptography bouncing around my head for a while before watching this, I decided this was the project i will chose from the video above. 

My main and only challenge, was figuring out what I could do differently. why I say this is because i don't do projects unless, I can change and add new features to them. The new features are inputs for messages and shifts, as well as user menus for terminal.

## How to Use the Project

1. **Clone The Repository:**

    This saves the project to your local device, you can do this using git.

2. **Run The Program:**

    Once you have cloned the repository, open the terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the project. After you have done this run the following command: `python Ceasor_Cipher.py`.

3. **Choose An Operation:**

    When you start the program, you'll see a menu with three options:
   * **(1) Encryption:** This encrypts a message.
   * **(2) Decryption:** This Decrypts a message.
   * **(3) Exit:** This exits the program.

4. **Input Your Choice:**

   When prompted type `1`, `2`, or `3` and then press enter to choose the desired operation.
   
5. **For Encryption:**

    If you chose option 1:
    * Input a **shift value** (an integer) when prompted, this will determine how many letters to shift across.
    * Then enter the message you want to encrypt, the program will then encrypt and display the encrypted message.

6. **For Decryption:**

   If you chose option 2:
   * Input the same **shift value** you used for encryption.
   * Input the encrypted message, then the program will decrypt and display the orignal message.

7. **Exit The Program:**
   To exit the program, select option 3 to-do so.
